# INTENT

1. Recording my solution to Thorsten Ball's Writing An Interpreter In Go... but doing it in C
2. Why?
    1. Practicing my C
    2. Sharpening memory management intuitions
    3. Because it's fun
    4. To make me think more deeply about what I'm writing ie. resist just copying the code examples

- Completing clean up of parser_tests using TEST_INT and TEST_ENUM
- Are our structs aligned?
- Can any small functions be inlined?
- Consider snprintf method in ast statement printing - is this the worthwhile over strcat?
- Go back and be more thorough with NULL checking
- Consider writing parse_expression and parse_infix_expression using an explicit stack instead of a recursive call
